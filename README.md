Inbound Methodology(Conversion/Attraction). Sam, Walter

WHAT - Tailoring your app/product to the right people, not everyone. Make content that easily answers their questions
       and give them the tools to share it. Give your users the tools to promote your service themselves by providing
       a well designed and personalized product. By combining these ideas into the design and the content you create, 
       the right people will naturally find your site. "By publishing the right content in the right place at the right
       time, your marketing becomes relevant and helpful to your customers, not interruptive. Now thatâ€™s marketing people can love."

Inbound Methodology was born when Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah met at MIT in 2004
A blog that Dharmesh ran was getting abnormally high amounts of traffic. 
The two of them set out to find the answer and came up with inbound methodology.
While people were starting to catch on to the idea at the time as old marketing methods were becoming less effective,
Dharmesh and Brian were the first to make it their own in the form of their business HubSpot.
It's an idea that has become very familiar to us, inbound puts the customer first and focuses on the principle that
a superior service will market itself. And by implementing these ideas into your design, people will naturally
find and share your site.
Inbound marketing's more personal approach contrasts outbound's more in your face approach and creates a niche for 
small businesses. Potential customers will find your service through more organic means and feel less forced.
However, this is not limited to small businesses as many big companies have incorporated inbound ideas into their design, including
Netflix, Mozilla, and JCPenny (add more)
It's not only important from a business perspective but also a design perspective inbound ideas are synonymous with a good user experience. 
HubSpot presents the inbound process as 4 steps Attract, Convert, Close, Delight.
Attract: touch on Blogging, Search Engine Optimization, and Social Publishing
Convert: touch on Forms, Calls-to-Action, Landing Pages, Contact Information
Close: Keep in contact with your users
Delight: Surveys, Tailored Content, Social Monitoring
