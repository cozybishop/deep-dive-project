Inbound Methodology(Conversion/Attraction). Sam, Walter

WHAT - Tailoring your app/product to the right people, not everyone. Make content that easily answers their questions
       and give them the tools to share it. Give your users the tools to promote your service themselves by providing
       a well designed and personalized product. By combining these ideas into the design and the content you create, 
       the right people will naturally find your site. "By publishing the right content in the right place at the right
       time, your marketing becomes relevant and helpful to your customers, not interruptive. Now thatâ€™s marketing people can love."
