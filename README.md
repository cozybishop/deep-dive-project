Inbound Methodology(Conversion/Attraction). Sam, Walter

WHAT - Tailoring your app/product to the right people, not everyone. Make content that easily answers their questions
       and give them the tools to share it. Give your users the tools to promote your service themselves by providing
       a well designed and personalized product. By combining these ideas into the design and the content you create, 
       the right people will naturally find your site. "By publishing the right content in the right place at the right
       time, your marketing becomes relevant and helpful to your customers, not interruptive. Now that’s marketing people can love."

ATTRACT- Three important aspects are Blogging, Using Keywords, and Social Publishing. 

CONVERT- Three important aspects are Forms, Calls-to-action, Landing Pages.

Inbound Methodology was born when Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah met at MIT in 2004
A blog that Dharmesh ran was getting abnormally high amounts of traffic. 
The two of them set out to find the answer and came up with inbound methodology.
While people were starting to catch on to the idea at the time as old marketing methods were becoming less effective,
Dharmesh and Brian were the first to make it their own in the form of their business HubSpot.
It's an idea that has become very familiar to us, inbound puts the customer first and focuses on the principle that
a superior service will market itself. And by implementing these ideas into your design, people will naturally
find and share your site.
Inbound marketing's more personal approach contrasts outbound's more in your face approach and creates a niche for 
small businesses. Potential customers will find your service through more organic means and feel less forced.
However, this is not limited to small businesses as many big companies have incorporated inbound ideas into their design, including
Netflix, Mozilla, and JCPenny (add more)
It's not only important from a business perspective but also a design perspective inbound ideas are synonymous with a good user experience. 
HubSpot presents the inbound process as 4 steps Attract, Convert, Close, Delight.
Attract: touch on Blogging, Search Engine Optimization, and Social Publishing
Convert: touch on Forms, Calls-to-Action, Landing Pages, Contact Information
Close: Keep in contact with your users
Delight: Surveys, Tailored Content, Social Monitoring

ATTRACT NOTES:
Forty-four percent of clicks for B2B companies are directed to the business’ homepage, not a special landing page. And only about 22% of businesses are satisfied with their conversion rates. Which is sad.

FORMS:
HOW TO improve the performance of your registration forms:
Step #1: Get internal buy-in WITH FORM OPTIMIZATION
• REDUCE THE FIELDS ON THE FORMS
EXAMPLES
An experiment in which a luxury home builder drove a 166% increase in leads with an A/B test of a new form design
An experiment in which a business hosting services company drove a 188% increase in lead rate with an A/B test of a new form design
An experiment in which SmartBrief achieved an 816% growth in subscriptions with an A/B test of an optimized form page

CONVERSION RATE:

Step #2: Use A/B testing to learn about your potential customers.
Employ a regimented approach:

• Form a hypothesis about which changes will improve your form response
• Craft research questions that will enable you to learn if this hypothesis is true
• Launch an A/B test to see how your potential customers actually respond
• Learn about your customers from this test
• Use this new knowledge to make further changes and inform more tests.

Step #3: Do no harm
optimize the page itself besides only the forms.

LANDING PAGES
Why Landing Pages?
If you’re not using landing pages, your digital marketing plan probably looks something like:

Step 1. Strategy, implementation, ’n stuff
Step 2. Get ad in front of target audience/get target audience (that guy) to read email
Step 3. Convince that guy to click ad/email link
Step 4. Uh, now what? Homepage? I’m sure they’ll find what they’re looking for there…

If step 4 is to send that guy to a page on your website that doesn’t solely focus on the offer from your ad, then all the hard work of steps 1-3 are wasted. Step 4 is the conversion step, the one that turns visitors into leads or even better, sales for your business. But what’s the best way to get them to convert? Landing pages, of course, but you also need a clear call to action on your landing page in order to convert visitors to leads, here is why:

Pre-Qualify Leads for Sales
Every time a lead completes a form on a lead generation landing page, your marketing team is collecting valuable information about your leads. This information can then be used by your marketing team and then they can share it with the sales department.

Gain Insights Into the Effectiveness of Your Marketing Offers
Tracking and analyzing the metrics associated with each unique landing page, you can collect tons, no hordes of insight into your marketing performance, like how your various marketing offers compare, how visitors and leads are converting on your landing pages over time, and more. Using Google Analytics can be a potential tool to do this, which can give you gives you concrete data that can help you optimize and improve your marketing as a whole.

why use CRO? (Conversion Rate Optimization)
Optimizing your conversion rate means to make it better, to improve it. Improved conversion rate means improving your landing page’s ability to turn visitors into buyers. Improved number of buyers means more profit. Simple and true. Here’s this fact in equation form for you math folks:

Conversion Rate = Conversions (Monies) per Set Number Visitors

Improved Conversion Rate (via CRO) = MORE Conversions (Monies) per SAME Number Visitors = MORE Monies in Yo’ Pocket (Whoohoo!!)

Case Study #2 about iamge versus Video - Landing Page Image Outperforms Video, Increases Monthly Revenue by $106000
https://vwo.com/blog/image-outperforms-video-increases-monthly-revenue/
Test results

The image version outperformed the video version. When pitted against the original, the image version recorded a 3.92% increase in ‘Find a Community’ searches while the video version recorded just a 0.85% increase in searches. The image version also achieved the statistical confidence of 99.99%. The test was run for 2 months on over 30,000 visitors. Videos were just a distraction rather than a positive tool on his test sites.

According to Matt, the seemingly modest 3.92% increase in community searches will result in a more-than modest $106,000 additional monthly revenue.
