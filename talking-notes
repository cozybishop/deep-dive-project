Inbound Methodology was born when Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah met at MIT in 2004
A blog that Dharmesh ran was getting abnormally high amounts of traffic. 
The two of them set out to find the answer and came up with inbound methodology.
While people were starting to catch on to the idea at the time as old marketing methods were becoming less effective,
Dharmesh and Brian were the first to make it their own in the form of their business HubSpot.
It's an idea that has become very familiar to us, inbound puts the customer first and focuses on the principle that
a superior service will market itself. And by implementing these ideas into your design, people will naturally
find and share your site.
Inbound marketing's more personal approach contrasts outbound's more in your face approach and creates a niche for 
small businesses. Potential customers will find your service through more organic means and feel less forced.
HubSpot presents the inbound process as 4 steps Attract, Convert, Close, Delight.
